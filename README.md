# CPHControl
CPHControl is a Windows Forms Control using OpenGL for Data plotting. It can be used to plot data fast and with high resolution in a line graph. Try the TestApplication to see some sinus lines being plotted.
The Graph follows new data automatically. The user can interrupt auto-panning my dragging the graph area with the mouse or by zooming with the mousewheel.
